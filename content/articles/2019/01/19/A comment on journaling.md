List member Bob Lalasz sent in an insightful comment on my previous post ["Event-sourcing on paper"](https://tips.persistr.com/articles/event-sourcing-on-paper/):

> When I read this, I think: The traffic engineer was journaling because that’s the best way to understand precisely what the problem is and to devise the most effective solution. You could assume the problem was light timing, or absence of turn lanes, or a need for additional lanes, or something else — but you wouldn’t really know until you had a record of what was going on.

Thank you for allowing me to share this, Bob! You said it better than I did.

What could journaling help you with?
