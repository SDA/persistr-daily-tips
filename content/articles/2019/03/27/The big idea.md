My big idea is to accelerate adoption of event-sourcing, or more generally event-driven architectures. I'm passionate about it and I've been interested in event-driven code for the last 20 years, ever since my first co-op stint at EA Sports back in the 90s.

I think event-sourcing is either not well-known or misunderstood.

I'm on a mission to correct this.

What's yours?
