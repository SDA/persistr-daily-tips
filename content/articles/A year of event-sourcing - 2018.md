In 2017, I decided to make event-sourcing more accessible to small teams. I'd been using event-sourcing architectures for about a decade. Even with my experience, I always found it difficult to set up event-sourcing on a new project. I thought there had to be a better way to make event-sourcing easier.

With that in mind, I started building out an event-sourcing platform that would be easy to use. I called it Persistr, because it persists data forever. 

2018 turned out to be a real marquee year. Here are some highlights:

- Persistr platform was launched into production. However, I'm limiting its use to customers by invite-only, while we continue working on scaling it out.

- Launched our very own fully-automated [Persistr Status Page](https://status.persistr.com/), providing real-time API latency metrics and incident reports.

- Stabilized and launched the Persistr REST API.

- Launched the Persistr CLI, command-line interface for managing Persistr databases. The CLI accomplishes my vision for easy do-it-yourself provisioning of databases. It also provides convenient stream inspection, historical and real-time, useful for debugging.

- Launched [Persistr Docs](https://docs.persistr.com/), our online documentation platform. Currently, it provides documentation for the Persistr CLI.

- Similarly, launched the Persistr JavaScript libraries, for Node.js and browsers. I am particularly happy with how these turned out, as they make event-sourcing incredibly easy.

- Launched Persistr Console, a web application to visually browse events stored in your database.

- Introduced an early preview of Persistr Domain Model, a way to define your data models without writing code.

Looking forward to an equally great 2019.

Happy New Year!
